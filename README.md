# supporting data for [COVID-19 mRNA booster dose induces hybrid immunity-like antibody response](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.09.491201v1) #

## Summary ##
In this work we investigated, at single-cell level, the evolution of the B cell and antibody response in four donors after a third mRNA booster dose. Our data shows that a mRNA booster dose induces hybrid immunity-like antibody response and defines, at molecular level, the functional and genetic antibody features responsible of increased cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.
